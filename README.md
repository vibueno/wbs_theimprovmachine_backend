## Description

_The Improv Machine_ is an Improv input generator, which was my final project for the Full-Stack Web & App Development Bootcamp at WBS Coding School.

## Live

## Design

- Mobile first: the styles included in the main stylesheet are optimized for a minimum width of 240px. The file responsive.css builds on it by providing additional styles which make the site work correctly on bigger viewports.

## Programming

- **Fully responsive** (starting at 240px Unihertz of Jelly Pro, as fas as I know the smallest Smartphone widely available)
